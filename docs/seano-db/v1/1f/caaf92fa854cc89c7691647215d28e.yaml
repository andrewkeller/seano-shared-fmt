  - Move Mermaid's compiler out of Zarf and into the browser:
    - Node & NPM is no longer needed for Mermaid diagrams in ``seano``
    - Mermaid diagrams are now compiled on-the-fly when displayed

    Zarf's Mermaid compiler depended heavily on DocUtils giving us access to
    the DOM serialization.  This is fine if we're using DocUtils for parsing
    all kinds of markup, but alas, we won't be using it for Markdown.

    To make it easier for the ``seano`` views to support Markdown, Zarf's
    implementation of Mermaid diagrams no longer pre-compiles them into
    images during the compile phase, and instead defers the compilation to
    run time in the browser, via Mermaid's official JS-based compiler.

    As a consequence of this change, Node and NPM are no longer needed in
    order to have Mermaid diagrams in ``seano`` notes.

    Some of the new JS being used is part of some fairly new APIs, and it's
    likely that older browsers (such as IE) are probably not going to work.
    Iterate as necessary.

    No changes are required to adopt this change in any project.

    This change has no risk to customers because we don't ship any Mermaid
    diagrams to customers.

    Make sure the Mermaid diagram below displays in at least Chrome, Edge,
    Firefox, and Safari:

    .. mermaid::

        flowchart LR
        A[Christmas] -->|Get money| B(Go shopping)
        B --> C{Let me think}
        C -->|One| D[Laptop]
        C -->|Two| E[iPhone]
        C -->|Three| F[fa:fa-car Car]

    Permutations:

    #.  Should work on at least the latest versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox,
        and Safari.  Some relatively new browser APIs are being used in this
        work, so it's possible that something might break in older browsers.
        Because this isn't customer-facing, it's okay to only support new-ish
        browsers.

    #.  Should automatically choose the theme based on whether or not Dark Mode
        is enabled.  *(Note: you need to refresh the browser for Dark Mode
        changes to take effect)*
